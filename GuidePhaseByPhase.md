### Phase 2 - Backend Integration

Step 1: Setup Project Structure
Create the file structure according to the provided file tree. This involves creating all the necessary folders and files for both the .NET Core and Node.js components.
Step 2: .NET Core Implementation (User Management)

Create the .NET Core Project:
Copydotnet new webapi -n LoanManagement.API

Install Required NuGet Packages:
Copydotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
dotnet add package System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
dotnet add package BCrypt.Net-Next

Implement Models:

Create User.cs with the [Key] attribute for Id
Create AuthModels.cs for authentication requests/responses
Create ApiResponse.cs for standardized API responses


Implement Database Context:

Set up ApplicationDbContext.cs with User entity configuration
Configure entity relationships and constraints


Implement User Repository:

Create IUserRepository.cs interface
Create UserRepository.cs implementation using Entity Framework Core


Implement Authentication Services:

Create JWT token generation service
Create user registration and login services


Implement API Controllers:

Create AuthController.cs for authentication endpoints
Create UsersController.cs for user management endpoints


Configure Application Services:

Set up Dependency Injection in Program.cs
Configure JWT authentication
Configure CORS policies
Set up Swagger for API documentation



Step 3: Node.js Implementation (Loan Management)

Set Up Node.js Project:
Copynpm init -y
npm install express cors dotenv jsonwebtoken mssql uuid
npm install nodemon --save-dev

Create Configuration Files:

Create .env file with environment variables
Set up database configuration in db.js
Configure JWT settings in jwt.js


Implement Authentication Middleware:

Create middleware to validate JWT tokens
Create middleware for role-based authorization


Implement Loan Model:

Create Loan.js with CRUD operations using SQL queries
Ensure user relationships are properly maintained


Implement Loan Controller:

Create controller functions for loan operations
Implement business logic for loan management


Set Up API Routes:

Create route definitions for loan endpoints
Apply appropriate authentication and authorization


Configure Server:

Set up Express server with middleware
Add error handling
Connect routes to the application



Step 4: Database Setup

SQL Server Configuration:

Ensure SQL Server is properly configured
Set up appropriate connection strings for both applications
Enable automatic database creation and migrations


Schema Creation:

Create Users table with appropriate columns and constraints
Create Loans table with foreign key relationships



Step 5: Testing

Test .NET Core API:

Verify user registration and login functionality
Test role-based access control
Ensure JWT tokens are properly generated


Test Node.js API:

Verify loan application functionality
Test loan approval/rejection by loan officers
Ensure proper integration with the user management system


Test Cross-Service Integration:

Verify that JWT tokens from .NET Core are accepted by Node.js
Test end-to-end workflows involving both services



Step 6: Documentation

Create README.md:

Document system architecture
Provide setup instructions
Document API endpoints
Include security considerations



With this implementation, you'll have a complete backend for the Loan Management System with:

User management and authentication using .NET Core
Loan management using Node.js
JWT-based authentication across both services
SQL Server database integration
Role-based access control

Both components will work together seamlessly while maintaining their separate responsibilities.
